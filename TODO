[] Investigate use of removing Clone bound for some operations @started(20-04-28 20:42)
  We can remove the Clone bounds on the Leaf but Internal is going to require work. We need to
  implement a new Rc type that understands whether or not it has ever been cloned. Uncloned Rc's
  would allow mutatio without requiring the Clone bound.
  [] Create own Rc type.

[] Implement extra functions on the vector
 [] constant_of_length 
 [] reverse
 [] iter_mut
 [] insert_anywhere
 [] equal_range
 [] permute
 [] slice_extract vs slice_remove

[] Implement extension traits for nodes

[] Implement annotation methods for nodes

[] Remove function improvements

[] Split_at improvements

Focus
[] Investigate ZipFocus concept which allows you use a tuple vectors and treat them as a vector of tuples.
[] Write tests for concatenation and splits
[] Attempt to use Vector of BorrowNode's for storage

Documentation
[] Write documentation for methods with stubs
