[] Investigate use of removing Clone bound for some operations @started(20-04-28 20:42)
  We can remove the Clone bounds on the Leaf but Internal is going to require work. We need to
  implement a new Rc type that understands whether or not it has ever been cloned. Uncloned Rc's
  would allow mutatio without requiring the Clone bound.
  [] Create own Rc type.
    This is pretty hard, we want to add clone only if necessary. Cloning should never be necessary
    for things aren't clone.

[] Implement extra functions on the vector @started(20-04-28 21:23)

 ✔ reverse @started(20-04-28 21:32) @done(20-04-28 21:40) @lasted(8m28s)
 ✔ iter_mut @started(20-04-29 00:21) @done(20-04-29 00:35) @lasted(14m16s)
 [] insert_anywhere
   This is less useful for now as it requires set up for whether items have enough space for an item.
 [] equal_range
 ✘ permute @started(20-04-30 21:46) @cancelled(20-05-01 16:48) @wasted(19h2m52s)
 ✔ Better sort function names @started(20-05-01 16:48) @done(20-05-01 17:00) @lasted(12m5s)
 [] slice_extract vs slice_remove

[] Implement extension traits for nodes

[] Implement annotation methods for nodes

[] remove function improvements

[] Split_at improvements

Focus
✘ Investigate ZipFocus concept which allows you use a tuple vectors and treat them as a vector of tuples. @cancelled(20-04-30 01:08)
  ✔ Look at itertools for zip implementation @started(20-04-29 12:01) @done(20-04-29 14:57) @lasted(2h56m38s)
    Looks complicated to do easily, rather let's make a trait for things that are trait like. This
    way we can abstract the sort method
  ✔ Trait for foci for sort @started(20-04-29 14:57) @done(20-04-30 19:31) @lasted(1d4h34m55s)
    This ends up not being entirely necessary. We can write a trait for the Fn comparison to use in
    the permute.
[] Write tests for concatenation and splits
[] Attempt to use Vector of BorrowNode's for storage
[] Investigate spine like structure for Focus. (leading to tracking two positions)
[] Abstract over Focus or Vector like type

Documentation
[] Write documentation for methods with stubs
